Recipe for chile de arbol salsa.

Ingredients
	
	5 Tomatos
	1/2 Onion
	3 Garlic Cloves
	3 Tablespoons Knorr's Chicken Consome
	About 20 Chile de Arbol pods
	Cilantro to taste (generous amount recommended)
	Salt and Pepper to taste

Preparation

1.- Boil tomatos and peel them.
2.- Fry onion and garlic cloves until they're browned (a bit on the overcooked side).
3.- Boil the chile de arbol pods, covered. Don't discard water afterwards.
4.- Chop cilantro not too finely.
5.- Blend onion and garlic into a paste.
6.- Add, Knorr's chicken consome, salt, pepper, tomatoes and chile de arbol pods into blender. Mix in a small amount of the water used to boil the chile de arbol pods (around 1/2 cup more or less). 
7.- Blend everything until salsa reaches a thick liquid consistency. If consistency is too solid, add more chile water.
8.- After blending, mix in the chopped cilantro into the salsa. (Blend if desired, but use a lower blend setting to avoid mincing the cilantro).
9.- Serve with tortilla chips or into a serving bowl.
